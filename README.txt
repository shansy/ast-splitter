0. you need Python 2.7 and Google Chrome to run the program
1. download all the files into the same directory
2. run server.py from the terminal
for Mac OS: 
use “cd” to choose the correct directory (where the files are stored) , then write something like “sudo python server.py”;
you may have to input your password to use sudo
3. wait for about 5 minutes until all the files are loaded; then you’ll see the phrase “ready!”
4. open index.html in Google Chrome, enter your text (you can copy it from the example file named “text example from die Zeit.txt”), push the “split it” button, enjoy the result in a few seconds
5. once you are done if you are not going to use this program in the near future, interrupt the server (using ctrl+C for Mac OS). To start again you should begin from the Step 2. But if you are going to use the program often you can leave the server running.
NOTE: don’t change any files except “text example from die Zeit.txt”
